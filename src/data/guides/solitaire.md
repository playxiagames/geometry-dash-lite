# Solitaire - Complete Strategy Guide

## Basic Strategy

Solitaire is the timeless single-player card game that has entertained millions through its perfect balance of skill, strategy, and luck. The objective is to build four foundation piles from Ace to King in each suit by strategically moving cards between tableau columns. Success requires planning ahead, understanding card relationships, and making calculated decisions about when to reveal hidden cards versus when to build existing sequences.

**Foundation Building Priority**: The ultimate goal is completing four foundation piles (one per suit) from Ace to King. However, rushing to move cards to foundations isn't always optimal. Sometimes keeping cards in play provides more strategic options for uncovering hidden cards and building sequences.

**Tableau Management**: The seven tableau columns are your primary workspace for building descending sequences in alternating colors. Effective tableau management involves creating empty columns (which can hold any King), maintaining access to buried cards, and building sequences that maximize your options.

**Hidden Card Strategy**: Approximately half of the deck starts face-down in tableau columns. Your primary strategic focus should be revealing these hidden cards, as they often contain the keys to completing the game. Prioritize moves that flip over new cards rather than just organizing existing face-up cards.

**Sequence Building Logic**: Build tableau sequences by placing cards in descending order with alternating colors (red on black, black on red). Longer sequences can be moved together, so building extended sequences creates powerful tools for reorganizing the tableau and accessing buried cards.

## Advanced Tips

**Empty Column Management**: Empty tableau columns are extremely valuable because they can accept any King, providing flexibility for reorganizing sequences. Don't fill empty columns immediately; consider whether keeping them open provides better strategic options for future moves.

**King Placement Strategy**: Kings can only be placed in empty columns or on Queens, making their placement crucial. Don't move Kings to empty columns unless you have a clear plan for building on them or unless doing so reveals important hidden cards.

**Stock Pile Optimization**: When drawing from the stock pile (typically three cards at a time in standard rules), pay attention to the order of available cards. Sometimes cycling through the stock multiple times reveals better play sequences.

**Suit Separation Planning**: While building foundation piles, consider the impact on your tableau sequences. Removing a card that's part of a long sequence might hurt your ability to move other cards later in the game.

**Multiple Move Visualization**: Before making any move, visualize the chain of moves it enables. The best moves often create cascades of additional opportunities rather than just solving immediate problems.

## Level Walkthrough

**Opening Assessment**: Begin each game by analyzing the initial tableau layout. Identify immediately available moves, note which columns have the most hidden cards, and spot any Aces or low cards that can start foundation piles.

**Early Game Priorities**: Focus on moves that reveal hidden cards, especially in columns with many face-down cards. Don't rush to build foundations unless doing so opens up significant new opportunities.

**Mid-Game Development**: Once you've revealed several hidden cards and established some sequences, start thinking more strategically about foundation building and sequence optimization. Look for opportunities to create empty columns.

**Late Game Execution**: With most cards revealed, focus on efficient sequence manipulation to complete foundation piles. This often requires careful planning to ensure you don't block essential moves.

**Endgame Precision**: The final moves often require precise sequence manipulation to extract specific cards needed for foundation completion. Take time to plan these moves carefully to avoid getting stuck.

## Common Mistakes

**Premature Foundation Building**: Moving cards to foundation piles too early can limit your options for tableau manipulation. Only build foundations when it doesn't hurt your ability to make other necessary moves.

**Wasting Empty Columns**: Filling empty columns immediately with any available King wastes their strategic value. Keep empty columns available until you can use them productively for sequence reorganization.

**Short-Term Thinking**: Making moves that solve immediate problems but create bigger problems later is a common error. Always consider the long-term implications of your moves.

**Ignoring Hidden Cards**: Focusing too much on organizing visible cards while ignoring opportunities to reveal hidden cards often leads to unwinnable positions. Hidden cards should be your primary priority.

**Stock Pile Mismanagement**: Not paying attention to the order and cycling of stock pile cards can cause you to miss important opportunities or make suboptimal plays.

## Score Optimization

**Move Minimization**: Completing games with fewer moves demonstrates efficient strategy and forward planning. Focus on moves that accomplish multiple objectives rather than single-purpose moves.

**Time Efficiency**: Faster completion times show both strategic skill and decision-making speed. However, don't sacrifice strategic thinking for speed, as hasty moves often lead to unwinnable positions.

**Win Rate Maximization**: Achieving higher win percentages requires consistent application of good strategy rather than relying on luck. Track your performance to identify patterns in your strategic approach.

**Streak Building**: Winning multiple consecutive games demonstrates reliable strategic skills rather than occasional good fortune. Develop consistent approaches that work across different layouts.

**Difficulty Mastery**: Some solitaire variants offer different difficulty levels or rule variations. Mastering harder variants shows advanced strategic thinking and adaptability.

## Final Pro Tips

**Pattern Recognition**: Develop recognition of common card patterns and layouts that indicate good or poor winning chances. This helps you identify when to restart versus when to persist with challenging games.

**Undo Feature Usage**: If playing digital versions with undo features, use them strategically to explore different move sequences rather than just correcting mistakes. This helps you learn optimal play patterns.

**Variant Exploration**: Try different solitaire variants (Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid) to develop broader strategic thinking skills that can improve your standard Solitaire play.

**Mental Patience**: Solitaire rewards patient, thoughtful play over hasty decisions. Develop the mental discipline to analyze positions thoroughly before committing to moves.

**Layout Analysis**: Spend time at the beginning of each game analyzing the complete layout to identify potential problems and opportunities before making your first move.

**Sequence Planning**: Learn to visualize long sequences of moves rather than just the immediate next move. The best solitaire players think several moves ahead.

**Statistical Awareness**: Understand that not all solitaire games are winnable with perfect play. Don't get frustrated by occasional unwinnable layouts; focus on playing winnable games optimally.

**Relaxation Benefits**: Use solitaire as a mental break or stress relief activity. The game's meditative qualities can provide psychological benefits beyond entertainment value.

Solitaire represents the perfect single-player card game experience, combining elements of skill, strategy, and chance in a format that provides both quick entertainment and deep strategic challenges through its elegant rules and infinite variety of layout possibilities.
