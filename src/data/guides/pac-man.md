# Pac-Man - Complete Strategy Guide

## Basic Strategy

Pac-Man stands as one of gaming's most iconic and enduring challenges, combining simple controls with deep strategic gameplay that rewards pattern recognition, timing precision, and tactical thinking. Success requires understanding ghost behavior patterns, optimizing maze navigation, and managing the risk-reward dynamics of power pellet usage.

**Ghost Behavior Understanding**: Each ghost follows distinct behavioral patterns that create predictable yet complex interactions. Blinky (red) directly pursues Pac-Man, Pinky (pink) attempts to ambush by targeting ahead of Pac-Man's current direction, Inky (cyan) uses complex targeting based on Blinky's position, and Sue/Clyde (orange) alternates between pursuit and retreat behaviors.

**Maze Navigation Mastery**: The maze layout contains strategic chokepoints, escape routes, and optimal paths that experienced players learn to exploit. Understanding which routes provide safety, which enable efficient dot clearing, and which offer tactical advantages forms the foundation of advanced play.

**Power Pellet Strategy**: The four power pellets transform the game dynamics by temporarily making ghosts vulnerable. Strategic power pellet usage involves timing consumption for maximum ghost elimination while maintaining positional safety and maze control.

**Scoring Optimization**: Points in Pac-Man come from dots (10 points), power pellets (50 points), vulnerable ghosts (200-1600-3200-5000 points per power pellet cycle), and bonus fruits (100-5000 points). Understanding scoring mechanics enables strategic decisions that maximize point accumulation.

**Pattern Recognition**: Pac-Man's seemingly chaotic action actually follows deterministic patterns that can be learned and exploited. These patterns enable consistent high-level performance and provide the foundation for speedrun techniques.

**Survival vs. Scoring Balance**: Players must constantly balance aggressive play for high scores against conservative survival strategies. This risk management becomes increasingly critical as game speed increases in higher levels.

## Advanced Tips

**Ghost Mode Cycles**: Ghosts alternate between "scatter" mode (retreating to corners) and "chase" mode (actively pursuing Pac-Man) in timed cycles. Learning these timing patterns allows you to predict behavioral changes and plan movements accordingly.

**Corner Trapping**: Master techniques for trapping ghosts in corners or dead-end areas, particularly when they're vulnerable. This skill allows for more aggressive power pellet strategies and higher scores.

**Tunnel Strategy**: The side tunnels that wrap around the screen provide escape routes and strategic opportunities. Ghosts move slower in tunnels, creating opportunities for evasion or repositioning.

**Fruit Timing**: Bonus fruits appear at specific point totals and disappear after limited time. Plan your movement patterns to efficiently collect fruits while maintaining safety and maze control.

**Speed Manipulation**: Pac-Man moves slightly faster when not eating dots, and turning around instantly reverses direction. These movement mechanics can be exploited for precise positioning and ghost evasion.

**Pattern Memorization**: Advanced players memorize specific movement patterns that safely clear entire levels while maximizing scoring opportunities. These patterns remove randomness and ensure consistent performance.

**Level Progression Understanding**: Game speed, ghost aggressiveness, and other parameters change systematically as levels progress. Adapting strategies for increased difficulty maintains performance as challenges escalate.

## Level Walkthrough

**Level Opening**: Begin each level by quickly assessing ghost starting positions and planning initial movement to establish favorable positioning while beginning systematic dot clearing.

**Early Clearing Phase**: Focus on clearing peripheral areas first, saving central maze areas for when escape routes become limited. This approach maintains maximum tactical options for as long as possible.

**Power Pellet Timing**: Use power pellets strategically when multiple ghosts are nearby and you have planned escape routes. The goal is maximizing vulnerable ghost consumption while maintaining positional safety.

**Mid-Level Management**: As dot density decreases, ghosts become more aggressive and predictable. Adapt your strategy to focus more on ghost pattern exploitation and less on maze exploration.

**Final Dot Strategy**: The last few dots require careful planning since limited options remain. Often, specific movement sequences are necessary to safely clear final maze areas.

**Level Completion**: Complete levels efficiently to preserve lives and maintain scoring momentum into increasingly challenging subsequent levels.

## Common Mistakes

**Panic Movement**: Making random directional changes when surrounded by ghosts instead of following planned escape routes or strategic patterns. Panic movement often leads directly into ghost paths.

**Power Pellet Waste**: Consuming power pellets when few ghosts are nearby or when positioned poorly for ghost consumption. This wastes the primary scoring opportunity and defensive resource.

**Corner Trapping**: Getting trapped in dead-end areas without planned escape routes. Advanced maze knowledge prevents most corner trap situations through better route planning.

**Tunnel Hesitation**: Failing to use tunnels effectively for escape or strategic positioning. Tunnel usage is often the difference between survival and capture in tight situations.

**Pattern Breaking**: Deviating from proven safe movement patterns in favor of risky improvisation. While adaptability is important, abandoning reliable patterns often leads to unnecessary deaths.

**Fruit Negligence**: Ignoring bonus fruit opportunities due to poor timing or positioning. Fruits provide significant scoring opportunities that should be integrated into overall strategy.

## Score Optimization

**Perfect Clears**: Achieve perfect levels by consuming all four ghosts with each power pellet. This maximizes scoring potential and requires precise positioning and timing execution.

**Ghost Value Maximization**: Understand that ghost values increase within each power pellet cycle (200-400-800-1600) and reset with each new power pellet. Plan consumption sequences for maximum point extraction.

**Fruit Integration**: Incorporate fruit collection into movement patterns rather than treating it as separate objective. Efficient fruit collection maintains scoring momentum without compromising safety.

**Level Completion Speed**: Balance thorough dot clearing with efficient level completion to maintain high scoring rates across multiple levels before difficulty becomes overwhelming.

**Risk-Reward Assessment**: Make informed decisions about aggressive plays versus conservative survival based on current score, remaining lives, and level difficulty.

**Pattern Perfection**: Master movement patterns that consistently achieve high scores rather than relying on opportunistic play that produces inconsistent results.
